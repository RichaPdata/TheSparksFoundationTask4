Task 4: Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm

Hello everyone,
This is my 4th task as a Data Science & Business Analytics Intern with The Sparks Foundation under 
#GRIPNOVEMBER23 batch.

Task Objective: Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm
Exploring Decision Trees with the Iris Dataset.
Dataset link: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
Language used: Python

Aim: 1)For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
2)The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

Leveraging decision trees for classification, I was impressed by their intuitive nature and interpretability, making them an excellent choice for beginners in the field of machine learning. Upon training the model and visualising the data, I was astounded by its remarkable ability to predict new data points. This experience reinforced my belief in the power of machine learning to uncover hidden patterns and insights.

Workflow behind Implementation of Decision Tree Classifier: 
1. Importing the Necessary libraries
2. Exploring the Data
3. Splitting Data into Train Data & Test Data
4. Decision Tree Classifier
5. Constructing confusion matrix
6. Visualising the Decision Tree
